class Consolebank{
  String accountName;
  String accountNumber;
  double accountBalance = 0.0;
  
  Consolebank({this.accountName, this.accountNumber});
    
  void getAccountBalance(){
  print('$accountName your account with number $accountNumber has a balance of $accountBalance');
  }
  String deposit(double amount){
    accountBalance += amount;
     print('Money Deposited Successfully');
    return 'You have successfully deposited $amount and your available balance is now $accountBalance';
  }
  String withdrawal(double amount){
    if(amount > accountBalance){
    print('Insufficient Funds');
